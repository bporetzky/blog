  <h2>&quot;All faults may be forgiven of him who has perfect candor.&quot; - Walt Whitman </h2>

  <h2>&quot;The true object of all human life is play.&quot;

-G. K. Chesterton </h2>
  <h2>&quot;This is the real secret of life -- to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.&quot; - Alan W. Watts</h2>
  <h2>&quot;Conviction is worthless unless it is converted into conduct.&quot; - Thomas Carlyle</h2>

  <h2>But: If you have convictions one way or the other, any truth which dares to try to exert itself must be destroyed to save your convictions. And that is where things begin to go badly for all. When the truth is attacked because it doesn’t fit within our convictions, we have all lost.

Whether you put much stock in Nietzsche or not, I believe that this quote has a place in our toolbox. If we know ourselves and can present our convictions with facts and truth, and withstand the challenges of other views, we can be relatively certain we are right. At least for now.

&quot;The measure of intelligence is the ability to change. &quot;</h2>
  <h2>Goals 2016</h2>
